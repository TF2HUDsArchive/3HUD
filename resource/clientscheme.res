//During development, one of my ideas was to add a skin support feature. The idea is, you'd be able to swap between two different clientscheme files by making edits here. It works but there's no skins besides default.
//Clientscheme files contain things like textures, colors, fonts and more. By swapping the files you change those things.
//I was planning to implement a TF2 themed skin (fonts, colors and all) but obviously I didn't have time to complete it in time for release.
//As I type this, only 5 days remain until the TFTV hud contest reaches its deadline. Yikes.

//But you found it. Hooray. You are special. If you want to edit my HUD, I'll warn you not make any large changes because I'm going to update it often (hopefully), due to it being in BETA.
//If that doesn't stop you, just edit the SolarLight skin file. Or, if you know how, you can take advantage of the #base technique I'm using below.

#base "../resource/clientscheme_solarlight_skin.res"
//#base "../resource/clientscheme_tf2theme_skin.res"
